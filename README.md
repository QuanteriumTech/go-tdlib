# go-tdlib ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.1-blue.svg)

Golang [TDLib](https://github.com/tdlib/td) (Telegram Database library) wrapper for building [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) clients.

> Current version of `tdlib` used is `v1.6.0`.

All the classes and functions declared in [TDlib TypeLanguage schema](https://github.com/tdlib/td/blob/master/td/generate/scheme/td_api.tl) file have been exported using the autogenerate tool [tl-parser](https://github.com/Arman92/go-tl-parser). So you can use every single type and method in TDlib.

## Key features

* Autogenerated golang structs and methods of `tdlib.tl` schema.

* Custom event receivers defined by user (e.g. get only text messages from a specific user).

* Supports all tdjson functions: Send(), Execute(), Receive(), Destroy(), SetFilePath(), SetLogVerbosityLevel().

* Supports all tdlib functions and types.

## Installation

`go-tdlib` provides an installation script to enable static linking of modules.

> Installation script only available for `macOS`.

> In case of build errors, refer to [TDlib build instructions](https://github.com/tdlib/td#building).

> Build uses a specific version of openssl (v1.1.0) whereby `libcrypto.1.1.dylib` and `libssl.1.1.dylib` should be copied and not their generic counterpart.
